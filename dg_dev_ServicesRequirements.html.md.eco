This page lists all of the required documents for services. Provide each of these documents before publishing your package so the purpose and use of each service is easy to understand. All of the documentation for services appears in the <a href="/services/">API Docs</a> section of the Dev Portal. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the Service documentation before creating it. For information on how to build and publish documentation, see the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/">Documentation SDK</a>. When writing any documentation for YaaS, including API Documentation, follow the <a href="#AbouttheStyleandStandards">Styles and Standards</a>.

#### Multiple versions of documentation
Because it is required to keep the previous version of a service available for three months after a new version releases, you must also keep the documentation for that version for that same period of time. Use the code in the registry sample file <strong>service-sample-simpleWithTwoVersions.json</strong>. The code creates a <strong>latest</strong> link in the URL to the latest version, and a drop-down menu next to the service name in the API documentation.

For an example of a service with multiple versions, see the <a href="/services/email/latest/">Email service</a>.

#### RAML file

<%- @partial('dg_dev_RAMLfile') %>


### Expose the Service URL
Expose the Service URL because it is the key component of your service. The <strong>baseUri</strong> automatically generates based on the values provided in the registry JSON file for the following attributes:
<ul><strong>
  <li>builder_identifier</li>
  <li>builder_org</li>
  <li>version</li>
</strong></ul>

The values combine to form the <strong>baseUri</strong> as shown:
<pre><code>
https://api.yaas.io/{builder_org}/{builder_identifier}/{version}
</code></pre>

To provide a custom <strong>baseUri</strong>, add a field called <code>baseUri</code> to the JSON file, and the value from that field displays in the Dev Portal. For example:
<pre><code>
"baseUri": "https://api.stage.yaas.io/hybris/tax-avalara/v1"
</code></pre>

The Dev Portal uses the <strong>baseURI</strong> in the following ways:

  <ul>
    <li>It appears the top of the service documentation, in the <strong>SERVICE URL</strong> box.</li>
    <li>The API Console uses it to perform REST calls on the proper service instances.</li>
    <li>Partials in the documentation use the<strong>baseURI</strong> to always refer to the latest service version's URL.</li>
  </ul>

Learn more about partials by reading the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/#ReuseContent">Reuse Content</a> section.

### Overview document

The Overview document is concise and briefly describes the purpose and intended use of the service. Use the proper metadata as described in the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/#Metadata"> Metadata</a> section of the Documentation SDK. Make sure to include the following:

  <ul>
    <li>Describe who might use the service and why.</li>
    <li>List the key features of the service in bullet points. Provide more in-depth information in the <strong>Details</strong> section. Do <i>not</i> explain RESTful API basic functions as a feature of the service.</li>
    <li>Describe how this service relates to other services, and describe any dependencies, including appropriate links to those dependencies.</li>
    <li>Optionally, list business examples.</li>
    <li>Optionally, list any prerequisites with a short description and relevant links to tutorials or documentation.</li>
  </ul>

### API Console and API Reference documents

When you follow the instructions to register your service in the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/">Documentation SDK</a>, the following occurs:
  <ul>
    <li>The API Console link displays automatically in a yellow button at the top of the API documentation.</li>
    <li>The API Reference content and navigation node automatically generates. Even though this is automatically generated, check the RAML file to ensure it is up to date with samples and clear descriptions.</li>
    <li>A link to the API Reference appears at the bottom of each tutorial for more information about error messages, so make sure the RAML file also describes error messages.
    <li>The RAML file is available at the top of the API documentation for users to copy or download. Make sure to put the <code>displayName:Managing Data</code> description under the root <strong>/resource</strong> in the RAML file. This display name is then visible instead of the root resource name.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="panel note">If your service does not expose its API, set the <strong>raml</strong> attribute to <code>false</code> in the registry JSON file, and neither the API Console or API Reference displays in the documentation. Also, set the <strong>baseUri</strong> attribute to <code>Not applicable</code> to display this text instead of the link to the RAML file. See the JSON templates for more details. For an example, see the <a href="/services/profileenricher/latest/index.html">Profile Enricher</a> documentation.</div>

If the API Console or API Reference is <i>not</i> available after following the registration instructions, check the following:
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>baseURI</strong> link to the service provided in the Dev Portal registry</a> exists and is up to date with your service version.</li>
    <li>By default, the Dev Portal collects the first RAML file found in your project and uses it for generation. If you are using more then one RAML file in your project, specify which file to use in the registry.</li>
    <li>When including hybris traits in your RAML file, use the full URL including the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.</li>
  </ul>

### Events document

The Events document is required for services that use the PubSub service to broadcast events that other services can consume.

First, list the <strong>topic owner client</strong> above the table. This is one per service, such as <strong>hybris.authorization</strong> for the OAuth2 service. Then, in the table, list the event type, a description, the link to the schema, and a payload example. You do not need to explain how to consume the event.

<div class="expand-collapse" data-caption="See the Events template">

<p>The Events template is printed below, or you can download the template:</p><br>

### Details document

The Details documentation contains more in-depth details about the service. Use the proper metadata as described in the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/#Metadata"> Metadata</a> section of the Documentation SDK. The details are listed in a logical order, starting with the architecture, scopes, and limitations of the service.

  <ul>
    <li>Include a diagram of the service to illustrate the service execution flow, especially for complex services or a mashup.</li>
    <li>Define scopes for all services. List the information in a table, including the name of the scope and a short description of what the scope does.</li>
    <li>List any limitations of the service.</li>
  </ul>

Give more details about the main features listed in the Overview, and any other features not listed. Each feature is described in a separate heading, and more complex details in sub-headings within the feature. Make sure to include the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Describe the service in detail, including who would use it, when, and why.</li>
    <li>Include relevant use cases, describing any real world problems the service can solve.</li>
    <li>Explain any YaaS terms using the glossary feature, and add any relevant links to the tutorials or FAQs.</li>
    <li>List any considerations, tricks, or workarounds that help users make the most of using the service.</li>
  </ul>

### Tutorials
Tutorials in your documentation explain and demonstrate in step-by-step fashion how to use the service. Because the website navigation indicates that these documents are tutorials, the titles should be succinct. Do NOT include "How To" in the title.

<p>The tutorials are targeted at developers with different amounts of experience with YaaS. For that reason, structure the tutorials so that a beginner can follow the most basic steps, and more experienced developers can learn more fine-grained details, such as troubleshooting or more use cases. Be sure to include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title – Give the tutorial a descriptive title, without the words "How To".</li>
  <li>Introduction – Introduce each tutorial separately, or as a whole. Be sure to explain any common use-case theme, such as a certain store name with certain products for sale. Also, state the objective of the tutorials and any prerequisites.</li>
  <li>Step-by-step – Include detailed steps in a quick start guide, or create detailed, interactive steps.</li>
  <li>Request and response examples - If you include a sample request, list optional and required attributes separately in the request body.</li>
  <li>Errors – At the end of the tutorial, use the <strong>errors_global.html.md</strong> partial which inserts the wording, "For more information about error codes, see the API Reference."</li>
  <li>Optional troubleshooting - Besides providing the error codes, give tips on how to troubleshoot a problem after receiving an error.
  <li>Optional use cases – Show more than one use case to highlight different features.</li>
</ul>

### Security document
The Security document is required only for services with data protection requirements that are not supported locally. This document contains all of the details needed to ensure data privacy, which varies from service to service.

Refer to the documentation for the <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/services/us/document/latest/">Document service</a> and the <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/services/us/documentbackup/latest/">Document Backup service</a> for examples.

### Glossary document
Use the Glossary to define terms that are specific to each service. The Glossary generates at the bottom of each API document, after the tutorials. A glossary term should be succinct, and no more than a sentence long so that it displays nicely as a tooltip.

To add a term to the glossary:
  <ul>
    <li>Create the <strong>docu/partials</strong> directory if it doesn’t already exist.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>partials</strong> directory, create an HTML file in the form, <strong>servicename_term.html</strong>. For example: <strong>avalaratax_avalara.html</strong></li>
    <li>Use only the metadata provided in the template, and note the spaces after each <code>:</code>.

By default, a term in the glossary table renders exactly how it is typed in the <strong>term</strong> metadata. To render the term with an initial capital letter instead, change the <strong>lock_case</strong> metadata to <code>true</code>. For example:

<code>term: mixin</code><br>
<code>lock_case: false</code> (default) = mixin<br>
or<br>
<code>lock_case: true</code> = Mixin<br>

After creating a partial for the glossary term, you can use it in your documentation with the partial code, as described in the <a href="/tools/documentationsdk/#ReuseContent">Reuse Content</a> section of the Documentation SDK. For example, if you include <code>&lt;%- @partial('avalaratax_avalara') %&gt;</code> in your document, the result is:<a class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="A company that provides services for sales tax management.">Avalara</a>

Any documents containing partials must have a <code>.eco</code> extension. For example:
<strong>overview.html.eco</strong> or <strong>overview.html.md.eco</strong>.
