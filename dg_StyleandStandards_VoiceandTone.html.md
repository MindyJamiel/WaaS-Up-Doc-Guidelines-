In YaaS, voice and tone standards apply to the different areas of `yaas.io`. First, it is important to understand the difference between voice and tone, and then follow the guidelines for writing content in the proper tone, depending on the destination for your documentation.

<h3>Difference between voice and tone</h3>

The difference between voice and tone can be a bit hard to differentiate at first. But think about the sound of your own voice, or a certain phrase that you use often. Those characteristics define your voice. When you address different people, or write documentation for different situations, you still have the same voice, but you might use a different tone. For instance, if you beat a friend in foosball, you might say, "I crushed you!" But if you beat your child at foosball, you might say, "Good game, kid."

<h3>Tones in YaaS</h3>
There are different tones for the different areas of the `yaas.io` domain. The following describes the recommended tone to strive for in your documentation, based on its location in YaaS.

<h4>Dev Portal</h4>
The Dev Portal docs can range from instructional to somewhat conversational, but always with the goal of helping developer users understand how to use YaaS for practical purposes and, in blogs and release notes, also helping business users understand changes so they can plan according to their business needs. The Dev Portal tone is: <br><br>
* Instructional and factual
* Detailed, with use cases and examples

<h5>Example</h5>
Use the Cart service to easily configure a retail cart service, for example, on a T-shirt web site. Call the Cart service endpoints to:<br><br>

* Create a new cart
* Add items to a cart
* Retrieve the details of items within a cart

See the Cart service tutorials for step-by-step instructions and request and response examples for each of these Cart service tasks. See the API Reference for the methods and API endpoints to use for each call.
