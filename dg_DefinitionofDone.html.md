In YaaS, the product is not done until the documentation is done. For instance, if you have a new service, feature, or solution to publish, you also need adequate documentation to release at the same time. This ensures readers fully understand the product and how to use it.

A product documentation review before publication ensures the content meets the requirements and guidelines. Each contributor allows time for a review cycle of the required documentation.
