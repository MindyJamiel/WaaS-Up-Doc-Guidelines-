These are the guidelines for basic text formatting, such as when to use bullets or tables. In general, content is easier to read when it is in chunks. Consider breaking up endless paragraphs by using a list or table.

### Ordered and unordered lists
As you write about your topic, use lists to create visual clarity within your content, listing items in a category or listing items in a sequence. Use an ordered, or numbered, list for sequential, instructional steps. Unordered lists are appropriate for list items that have no sequential order, such as a list of valid file types. Follow these guidelines for creating a list:
* Make list content consistent in structure. For example, make all the bullet points sentences, questions, or sentence fragments, but do not mix types.
* Punctuate bullet points consistently. If they are all sentences, use periods. If they are sentence fragments, do not use periods.
* Avoid ending bullet points with punctuation such as semicolons or commas.
* Capitalize the first letter of each bullet point consistently. Capitalize the first letter unless the list items are always lowercased, as with parameters names.
* Emphasize the beginning of the bullet point to capture the main idea.
* If readers must perform list items in order, as in a step-by-step procedure, use an ordered list, and maintain the consistency in structure.

### Tables
Another effective way to chunk content is to use tables. Use them when content needs comparison, or as a way to provide information mapping. Think of a table as a list, but with optional columns to provide and organize more information than belongs in a list. Make sure tables are not too long or hard to read, causing the reader to scroll a lot. Break up a long table into multiple tables, if possible. For an example, see the <a href="#AbouttheStyleandStandards">Style and Standards</a> tables.

### Format specific elements
To learn how to format YaaS-specific items such as package or service names, see the <a href="#YaaSTerminology">YaaS terminology</a> section of the Style and Standards document. The following tables outline when to use bold font and when to use code font for many items that relate to software development in YaaS.

##### Use bold font for these items:
|Items|Examples|
|-----|--------|
|Parameters<br>Events<br>File names<br>Path names<br>Scopes|The **partial** attribute is optional.<br>The service publishes a **password-reset-requested** event.<br>Open the **pom.xml** file.<br>Save the file in the **\services\repository\** folder.<br>Use the **hybris.profile_graph_view** scope to view data in the graph.|

##### Use code font for these items:
|Items|Examples|
|-----|--------|
|Code examples<br>Values<br>Endpoints<br>Status and error codes<br>Parameter and value pairs|Verify the installation with the <code>mvn help:system</code> command.<br>Set the **partial** attribute to `true` to perform a partial replacement.<br>Send a POST request to the `/{tenant}/categories/{categoryId}/media/{mediaId}/commit` endpoint.<br>A successful response includes a status code of `200 OK`.<br>To perform a partial replacement, include `partial=true` in your request.|
