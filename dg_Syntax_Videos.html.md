This document contains the guidelines for creating videos for YaaS content. If you have already created a video that meets these guidelines, you can embed it in a page in the Dev Portal using the syntax provided in the <a href="/internal/tools/documentationsdk/index.html#EmbedVideos">Embed Videos</a> section. To record an animated or live-action video in a studio or at a customer site, follow the guidelines from the SAP Hybris Video team called, <a href="https://wiki.hybris.com/display/km/How+to+approach+a+video">How to approach a video</a>.

### Prepare the script
Use a table to structure your demo, recording, or podcast. In the table, relate the action performed to the narration in each step. The more detailed the script, the easier it is to record. State any prerequisite knowledge and background information for each step. Follow the <a href="#AbouttheStyleandStandards">Style and Standards</a>, where applicable. For instance, write and say, "the YaaS Market" instead of "the Marketplace", or any other verbiage.

#### Example
This table is an example of how to prepare the content and script.
<table class="table table-striped table-glossary techne-table">
<tr>
  <th>Step</th>
  <th>Action on screen</th>
  <th>Narration</th>
  <th>Duration</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Introduction</td>
  <td>No action, the screen shows the YaaS home page.</td>
  <td>"Today, I am going to show you how to change your default locale for your project in the Builder. Localization is very important when you have more than one country that subscribes to your services. You need to have a YaaS account first, of course, and a project already set up. If you don't, see the Getting Started Guides section in the Dev Portal."</td>

### Content preparation tips
Here are some tips for creating video content and scripts.

#### Introduction
Write an introduction that describes what the topic or demo is about and clearly state the objective. For example, "This video is an introduction to SAP Hybris Commerce as a Service. You will learn what the package dependencies are, how to use the services contained in the package, and how to customize it."

#### Body
Writing a script is different than normal documentation content because you write it in the way you speak, not in the way you read. Scripts must be easy for the listener to understand. Use short sentences, contractions, and simple words. A sentence shouldn't take more than one breath to say, so split complex sentences into two. Avoid using brackets in your script and any other punctuation that doesn't translate to audio. Spell out other punctuation to make it easier to read. Here are some examples:

* Spell out symbols such as percent, kilogram, or gigabyte.
* Spell out numbers one through nine, use numerals for 10 through 999, and spell out words such as thousand and million. Use the appropriate combinations, such as "22 million", or "50 by 50 pixels".
* Spell out URLs so they are easier to read, such as w-w-w-dot-hybris-dot-com.
* Use the active voice. Write clearly and concisely to convey the meaning instantly.
* If someone else is going to record your script, make sure they know how to pronounce any words or terms that are not obvious. For instance, it is pronounced "yaz", and not spelled out as "y-a-a-s."

#### Conclusion
When you finish the presentation, write a conclusion that states the topic and the objective again. For example, "This wraps up the introduction for the SAP Hybris Commerce as a Service topic. Hopefully, you understand now what is contained in the package, and how to use it, or customize it. Thanks for watching."

If applicable, refer the learner to watch the next related video, or direct them to more documentation. For example, "Watch the next demo on how to set up a storefront in ten minutes to see the Commerce functionality in action."

### Review process
Submit the script to <a href="mailto:team-q@sap.com">Team Q</a> for a review at least two weeks prior to your release date. After the script is reviewed, proceed to the video recording.

#### Translation to different languages
According to the current globalization policy, all training material including videos are in English only to reduce cost and effort. If the video is not available in English, or the audio or pronunciation is not clear, the Education team can add subtitles to your script. Allow ample time for the team to add subtitles before publication.

### Prepare the environment
Before recording a video, make sure the environment and any necessary generic accounts are set up. For instance, create a sample project in the Builder and an account such as john.doe@mail.com. Don't use any personal accounts or any real company Builder projects in your video. Set up the environment using these tips:

* Close every application you don't need for the video, including instant messaging, mail, and any other application that might cause an unwanted pop-up during the recording.
* Silence your cell phone if it is nearby.
* Use a neutral desktop background, or a company-branded desktop.
* If using a browser during your video, open any web pages you need for your presentation in tabs. Remove any visible personal bookmarks or toolbars, and close any unrelated open tabs.
* Keep any needed files in a folder easily accessible on the Desktop.

<div class="panel note">If you have multiple presenters on one call, make sure each one is capturing a video. The Education or Video team can merge these videos into one afterwards.</div>

### Technical details
This section contains the technical requirements for making a video.

#### Select a tool
Mac users can use Quicktime Player or Camtasia. Windows users can use Camtasia. There is no record feature for Quicktime Player on the Windows platform. Quicktime Player is already installed on Macs, but you can also download <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/download/camtasia/">Camtasia</a> and get a license from the SAP SRM.

#### Download the slide deck
<a href="templates/YaaSvideos.zip">
Download</a> the YaaS Videos PowerPoint template to use when recording any slide shows.

#### Set the screen resolution
Before you record your screen on either Windows or Mac, set your screen resolution to the standard aspect ratio. For videos, it is 16:9 which results in resolutions of 3840x2160px, 1920x1080px, and 1280x720px. Setting the screen resolution is very important. A setting below these values results in a poor quality video. Always do a test recording first for five to ten seconds to check the quality of the recording after you output to a file.

<div class="panel warning">Because the built-in retina display of many laptops has an aspect ratio of 16:10, **use an external monitor** when recording any video.</div>

#### Set up the audio
Use an external USB headset and a good microphone to do the audio recording. These tools produce the best quality sound and eliminate the most background noise. Always check your headset settings in the OS first, and do a test recording first in the video application for five to ten seconds to check the quality of the audio. Speak clearly and at a normal volume level. It is best to have a native English speaker with good pronunciation.

If you make a mistake during video capture, do not start all over again. The section can be edited out, provided you restart in a place where the dialog and the screen environment are the same. If you mispronounce a word, say it again clearly and have the mispronunciation edited out.

#### Adjust the Camtasia settings for Windows
Start Camtasia on Windows and adjust these settings:

1. Start the Camtasia Recorder, not Camtasia Studio, as shown in this image:<br>
