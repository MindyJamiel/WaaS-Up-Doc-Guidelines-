Linking is a great tool to use to incorporate a lot of content into your document with fewer words. That said, overuse of linking can create "link rot" when links break, and if a page has more links than content, it is not very pleasing to read. Choose carefully when and how to link by using these best practices.

- Every link has the potential to go bad over time, and the more links you include, the higher the chance that one will break. If something is not central to the subject at hand, is well-known by your audience, or can be found with a simple search, there's no point in linking.
- For external links, link to the main page of the external website and then describe how to access the destination link. For example, `Go to the <a href="www.raml.org">RAML</a> website and click on the download link.` Main page URLs are less likely to change.
- Choose the link text carefully. Don't link entire phrases which become overemphatic. Instead, choose the noun, such as an article or specification within the phrase that helps the reader understand where the navigation leads them. Or use the title of the article or book as the link, but don't include the author and publisher.
- Link to web pages instead of PDFs whenever possible.
- Don't include spaces or other characters in the link that require escape characters for translation.
- Check your links often to make sure they are still operational. There are free online tools to make it easier.
