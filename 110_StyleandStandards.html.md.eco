The YaaS Style and Standards topic describes the grammar and word choices that give your documentation that special YaaS flavor and ensures that your content meets the requirements for publication on the Dev Portal. Because the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Manual-Style-4th-Edition/dp/0735648719">Microsoft Manual of Style - 4th Edition</a> (MMoS) is the selected style guide for the Dev Portal, this page documents only those standards that are applied differently, that the MMoS does not address, or that are specific only to YaaS. Search this page for any term to read about the standard.
